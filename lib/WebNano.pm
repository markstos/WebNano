=head1 NAME

WebNano - Really minimalistic web framework


=head1 VERSION

This document describes WebNano version 0.001


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    extend WebNano;

See the example in t/lib/MyApp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a minimalistic web framework - the main design goal of it is to delegate as much
as possible to specialized CPAN modules with minimal hassle. 

It currently uses: PSGI/Plack tools to ease deployment and testing and Bread::Board
to build the application components.  What is left is just dispatching (routing) - this
is built around the following design ideas:

=head2 Controllers (like Catalyst) with methods per sub-address 


=head2 Dispatching (routing) in controllers

This makes controllers more independent from the whole application and 
mixable with more flexibility.
This also leads to the elegant design of recursive dispatching -
you start from the root controller it then serves the request or
chooses another controller where the same thing happens
(sometimes called tree of resposibility - extension of the chain of responsibility 
design pattern).

=head2 Controller object live in the request scope (new controller per request)

If you need to build a heavy
structure used in the controller you can always build it as the
application attribute and use it in the controller as it has access to
the application object, but since all the work of controllers is done
in the request scope (i.e. creating the request) - then it makes sense
that the whole object lives in that scope.  This is the same as
Tatsumaki handlers (and controllers in Rails, Django and probably
other frameworks) - but different from Catalyst.


=head1 ATTRIBUTES and METHODS

=head2 handler

Returns a subroutine (with closure) suitable for handling PSGI request arrays.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=for author to fill in:
    List every single error and warning message that the module can
    generate (even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full
    explanation of each problem, one or more likely causes, and any
    suggested remedies.

=over

=item C<< Error message here, perhaps with %s placeholders >>

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

=for author to fill in:
    A full explanation of any configuration system(s) used by the
    module, including the names and locations of any configuration
    files, and the meaning of any environment variables or properties
    that can be set. These descriptions must also include details of any
    configuration language used.
  
WebNano requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of all the other modules that this module relies upon,
    including any restrictions on versions, and an indication whether
    the module is part of the standard Perl distribution, part of the
    module's distribution, or must be installed separately. ]

None.


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
    with. This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or
    competition for system or program resources, or due to internal
    limitations of Perl (for example, many modules that use source code
    filters are mutually incompatible).

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=for author to fill in:
    A list of known problems with the module, together with some
    indication Whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming
    release. Also a list of restrictions on the features the module
    does provide: data types that cannot be handled, performance issues
    and the circumstances in which they may arise, practical
    limitations on the size of data sets, special cases that are not
    (yet) handled, etc.

No bugs have been reported.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-webnano@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
